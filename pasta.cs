The screams of the damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems like hours, it’s finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself. My brain shuts down as my vision fades to black.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase *Wubba Lubba Dub Dub*, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

At long last, the wait is finally over.Quite possibly the most anticipated, highly praised, Academy Awards nominated piece presented by Polygon Pictures: Pingu In The City has finally come to its conclusion. There were tears, laughs, sighs of relieve, and joyous times all around the globe on March 31st, 2018.
Making its debut on Oct 7th 2017, fans, viewers, and even haters would rejoice for the Second Coming of animes.Some people were even skeptical about Pingu in a new environment; surrounded by the city lights, away from his igloo, making his debut into the big city. But boy, were they wrong. Once again, Pingu managed to captivate, charm, and woe us in this masterpiece of a show. Most of the people reading this review right now will think I'm simply just a troll, encouraging the word of our lord Pingu just to spread dead memes and lulz. Even the mods might delete this in due time. Rest assured though, I'm speaking sincerely from the bottom of my heart: I have never quite seen something so motivating, inspiring, heart-wrenching, and realistic modern anime in all my years of living.I will continue to spread the ways of Pinguism for as long as I live, no matter the costs.
This review, while may sounding biased(nothing wrong with that), will cover all the aspects of Pingu in the City. Sounds, artwork, story, and my overall enjoyment of the film - what I thought it did right, and what I thought it did right again. So without further ado, let's get to the main factors on why Pingu in the City has perfect tens across the board.
*We adults normally don't like work, we feel it's dull to work. But Pingu can change any dull work into a funny and interesting thing to do. So let's set Pingu the challenge to try out lots of different jobs.* - Naomi Iwata");

The Indianapolis is my favorite ship and I'm done with you guys calling her *loli bait* and *underage* she was launched over 80 years ago and her young appearance is just a personification of her superior speed and maneuverability unseen at the time in any other ship. She is caring and loyal and I won't forgive anyone that disrespects her");
